# usstm-website
This is PACS first project, creating the USSTM website.

## Prerequisites
Welcome and thank you for working on this project.

Before you work on this website there are some command line tools and extensions you need to install.

### Command Line Tools
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)
- [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/download)

### VSCode Extensions
- [Live Server](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer)
- [Tailwind CSS Intellisense](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=bradlc.vscode-tailwindcss)

## Cloning the Website
1. Clone the repo.
```
git clone https://github.com/PACS-TMU/usstm-website.git
```
2. Change into the repo directory.
```
cd usstm-website
```
3. Switch to the branch that you are working on by using:
```
git checkout <branch-name>
```

## Running the website
1. Install node modules
```
npm install
```
2. Run tailwind build process
```
npm run dev
```
3. Start up Live Server extension

## Coding
- Code in your respective or assigned branches to avoid git conflicts.
- Only code what you are assigned to code. To get assigned, take part in USSTM Website meetings where we split tasks. Or ask your Tech Team Lead for vacant tasks.

## Pure CSS coders
Pure CSS coders will still have to follow the above mentioned steps. When writing your own CSS, make sure you write in `/css/style.css` file and not touch the `/css/tailwind.css` file. Tailwind will automatically take your CSS and apply it to the website.

If you have any questions or you are unsure of anything feel free to ask your Tech Team Leads.
