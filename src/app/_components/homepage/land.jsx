            As a settler on this land, I acknowledge that I am on the traditional
            territory of the Mississaugas of the Credit First Nation, the
            Anishnabeg, the Chippewa, the Haudenosaunee and the Wendat peoples and
            home to many diverse Indigenous peoples. I also acknowledge that
            Toronto is covered by Treaty 13 with the Mississaugas of the Credit.
