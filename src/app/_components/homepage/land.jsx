              Toronto Metropolitan University is in the ‘Dish With One Spoon
              Territory’. The Dish With One Spoon is a treaty between the
              Anishinaabe, Mississaugas and Haudenosaunee that bound them to share
              the territory and protect the land. Subsequent Indigenous Nations
              and peoples, Europeans and all newcomers have been invited into this
              treaty in the spirit of peace, friendship and respect.

              The &quot;Dish&quot;, or sometimes it is called the &quot;Bowl&quot;, represents what is
              now southern Ontario, from the Great Lakes to Quebec and from Lake
              Simcoe into the United States. We all eat out of the Dish, all of
              us that share this territory, with only one spoon. That means we
              have to share the responsibility of ensuring the dish is never
              empty, which includes taking care of the land and the creatures we
              share it with. Importantly, there are no knives at the table,
              representing that we must keep the peace.
